# Text-Classification-Pipeline-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers
This project implements a Text Classification Pipeline using Hugging Face Transformers. It preprocesses and tokenizes text, fine-tunes a pre-trained model like DistilBERT, and predicts categories for new text. Useful for tasks like sentiment analysis. Built with Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and scikit-learn.
